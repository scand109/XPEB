Title: Cross-Population Empirical Bayes
Version: 0.1

Author: Hua Tang and Marc A. Coram
Description: This R package implements the cross-population empirical Bayes method, XPEB, described in Coram et al. 2015.  XPEB takes as input P-value summary statistics from two GWAS, a target-GWAS from for example an ethnic minority population of primary interest and an auxiliary base-GWAS such as a larger GWAS in Europeans, and reprioritizes SNPs in the target population to compute local false discovery rates. XPEB also estimates the degree of overlap in the genetic architecture underlying the trait in the two populations.
